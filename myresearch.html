				<p> My main research interest is protoplanetary discs, the environments where planets form.
					I am particularly keen to understanding the physical mechanisms that drive their evolution and
					consequent accretion of material onto the central protostar. To investigate this, I mostly rely on
					simulations (see the section Diskpop below) and analytical calculations, that allow us to test our
					theoretical expectations once compared with the observational data. Below, you will find a short 
					description of the main projects I am currently working on, as well as a selection of the past ones.

					<h1> Diskpop and popcorn </h1>

					<p>
						A significant part of my research relies of disc population synthesis, which I perform using the Python 1D code Diskpop and its
						own output analysis library, popcorn. I am one of the main active developers of both codes, and we are planning to release
						them soon with a paper I am currently writing. If you are interested in knowing more, as the codes are not public yet, feel
						free to <a href = "mailto:alice.somigliana@eso.org">contact me</a>.

						In the second project of my PhD I focused on the difference between the two main paradigms for protoplanetary disc evolution,
						namely viscosity and magnetohydrodynamic disc winds. In particular, I focused on the evolution of the distribution
						of the ratio between the disc mass and the accretion rate, a quantity often referred to as 'disc lifetime'. 
						I found that both the theoretical spread and skewness of the distribution are significantly model-dependent: 
						once convolved with the observational uncertainties, the difference in the spread remains appreciable, providing a novel
						way to distinguish between the two evolutionary models. This work is published in ApJL (<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023ApJ...954L..13S/abstract" target="_blank">Somigliana et al. 2023</a>).

						<h1> Evolution of the disc properties-stellar mass correlations </h1>

						<p> 
							In the first project of my PhD (started during my Master's thesis, supervised by Prof. Giuseppe Lodato at the University 
							of Milan and Dr. Giovanni Rosotti at the University of Leicester) I performed an analytical and numerical study of 
							the observed power-law correlations between the stellar mass and the disc properties (mainly disc mass and accretion rate).
							I assumed the correlations to hold as initial conditions and analysed the impact of pure viscous evolution, finding that
							the power-law shape is maintained while the slope are meant to reach the same value after a long enough time. This can
							happen either because they both increase, they both decrease, or they remain constant depending on their initial value. 
							The observed increase in the slopes (Ansdell et al. 2017) can be explained if the initial correlation between the disc and
							the stellar mass is steeper than that between the accretion rate and the stellar mass. You can read more in

						<p> 
							In my Bachelor's thesis, supervised by Prof. Giuseppe Lodato at the University of Milan, I studied the impact of internal
							photoevaporation on the so-called protoplanetary disc 'isochrones' (i.e., the curves described by a population of objects
							of the same age in a chosen plane) in the disc mass-accretion rate plane. I worked with an embryonal version of Diskpop, 
							written in Fortran 95 (!), and included the photoevaporative UV and X prescriptions of Clarke et al. (2001) and Owen et al. (2012)
							respectively. Internal photoevaporation acts as a disc dispersal mechanism and therefore plays a crucial role in viscous evolution,
							which would otherwise generate discs with infinite lifetime.
							
							I found that photoevaporation reduces the accretion rate for discs of a given mass with respect to the
							viscous counterpart: this effect modifies the linear shape (in the logarithmic plane), of isochrones, introducing a 'bending
							knee' at accretion rates corresponding to the mass-loss rate. This introduces a spread in accretion rates, that cannot be explained
							with purely viscous evolution. Moreover, I found that less massive discs are preferentially removed; this leads to the counterintuitive
							effect of an increase of the average disc mass over time. You can read more about this in 
							<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.492.1120S/abstract" target="_blank">Somigliana et al. 2020</a>.

						My PhD is funded through the ERC Synergy Grant ECOGAL (PIs Leonardo Testi, Sergio Molinari, Ralf Klessen, 
						Patrick Hennebelle). ECOGAL is an ambitious project that aims at building the first predictive model for the galactic ecosystem,
						bridging a variety of different spatial scales - including the very small ones of protoplanetary discs and planetary systems, 
						which my group focuses on. For more information on the projects, check out <a href="http://www.ecogal.eu" target="_blank">the ECOGAL website</a>.
